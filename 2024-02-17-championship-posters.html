<p>Starting with Super Bowl LVI, I started creating illustrations to
represent the teams in each of the big four North American men’s pro
sports championships. Usually I take inspiration from uniform or logo
elements.</p>
<h2 id="super-bowl-lvi">Super Bowl LVI</h2>
<p>Los Angeles Chargers 23, Cincinnati Bengals 20</p>
<p>“Los Angeles @ Cincinnati @ Los Angeles”</p>
<p>I can’t think of another team in any sport, besides the Rams, who
uses a spiral motif, so I wanted to emphasize that. Using two different
sets of spirals, the background and the eyes, was meant to show that the
Rams were both a participant in the game and the host of the game, as it
was played in their stadium.</p>

<h2 id="nba-finals">2022 NBA Finals</h2>
<p>Golden State Warriors 4, Boston Celtics 2</p>
<p>“San Francisco vs Bay State”</p>
<p>Warriors blue and yellow combine to make Celtics green. The design
uses the Celtics’ famous parquet floor to create the icons of the two
teams: the Bay Bridge and a shamrock, respectively. I like that Golden
State uses the state nickname in their team name; they’re the only big
four team to do it, but <a
href="/2020-04-12-state-nickname-teams.html">as I’ve written about, I’m
fascinated by state nicknames</a>.</p>
<p><img src="img/2024-02-17-championship-posters/2022-nba-finals.png" class="image-full-width" /></p>
<h2 id="stanley-cup-finals">2022 Stanley Cup Finals</h2>
<p>Colorado Avalanche 4, Tampa Bay Lightning 2</p>
<p>“Avalanches vs Lightnings”</p>
<p>I liked the idea that both teams could be represented by zigzags.
Tampa’s is pretty clear, but Colorado’s is based on <a
href="https://www.sportslogos.net/logos/view/810232018/Colorado_Avalanche/2018/Dark_Uniform">the
mountains around the waist of their jerseys</a> and the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Denver">flag of the city of
Denver</a>.</p>
<p><img src="img/2024-02-17-championship-posters/2022-stanley-cup.png" class="image-full-width" /></p>
<h2 id="world-series">2022 World Series</h2>
<p>Houston Astros 4, Philadelphia Phillies 2</p>
<p>“Phillies vs Houies”</p>
<p><a

“tequila sunrise”</a> fades into <a

burgundy and powder blue</a>.</p>
<p><img src="img/2024-02-17-championship-posters/2022-world-series.png" class="image-full-width" /></p>
<h2 id="super-bowl-lvii">Super Bowl LVII</h2>
<p>Kansas City 38, Philadelphia Eagles 35</p>
<p>I didn’t want to play up KC’s indigenous imagery, so I stayed simple
here by contrasting the texture of the Eagles’ wing with the edge of
KC’s arrowhead.</p>
<p><img src="img/2024-02-17-championship-posters/sblvii.png" class="image-full-width" /></p>
<h2 id="nba-finals-1">2023 NBA Finals</h2>
<p>Denver Nuggets 4, Miami Heat 1</p>
<p>This was a pretty straightforward combination of the Nuggets’
mountain with the Heat’s flames.</p>
<p><img src="img/2024-02-17-championship-posters/2023-nba-finals.png" class="image-full-width" /></p>
<h2 id="stanley-cup-finals-1">2023 Stanley Cup Finals</h2>
<p>Vegas Golden Knights 4, Florida Panthers 1</p>
<p>“Nevada Knights vs Lauderdale Golden Panthers”</p>
<p>These two teams have a surprising number of common aesthetic
elements. Both use gold prominently, along with red and a darker shade,
black and grey for Vegas and navy for Florida. Both have shields in
their logos. I averaged a colour between Vegas grey and Florida navy for
the background and picked a shield shape somewhere between the two. The
main imagery was a split between the Knights’ mask and the Panther head,
but I went back to the <a
href="https://www.sportslogos.net/logos/view/ejsvf6ira3ggsff4mjrxh4ree/Florida_Panthers/2010/Alternate_Logo">superior
front-facing panther for inspiration, specifically the simplified one in
the roundel</a>. When Florida went through their most recent redesign,
they introduced an <a
href="https://www.sportslogos.net/logos/view/1322432017/Florida_Panthers/2017/Alternate_Logo">updated
front-facing panther</a> but then never used it on a jersey, which is a
waste because it’s a much more impactful logo.</p>
<p><img src="img/2024-02-17-championship-posters/2023-stanley-cup.png" class="image-full-width" /></p>
<h2 id="world-series-1">2023 World Series</h2>
<p>Texas Rangers 4, Arizona Diamondbacks 1</p>
<p>“Texa-zona Ranger-backs”</p>
<p>While not geographically the southwestern-most World Series (I’m
thinking Giants versus Angels in 2002 probably was?) this must have been
the most southwestern themed. Thinking about snakes and cowboy hats, I
decided to combine them in something that would look like an
old-fashioned tattoo. And while the Rangers haven’t used cowboy boots in
their iconography as much as hats, I couldn’t pass up an alternate
“There’s a snake in my boot!” design.</p>
<p><img src="img/2024-02-17-championship-posters/2023-world-series.png" class="image-full-width" />
<img src="img/2024-02-17-championship-posters/2023-world-series-alt.png" class="image-full-width" /></p>
<h2 id="super-bowl-lviii">Super Bowl LVIII</h2>
<p>Kansas City 25, San Francisco 49ers 22</p>
<p>“Kan Francisco”</p>
<p>I was hoping Baltimore would win the AFC championship so that I could
do a design based on the Maryland flag, but this turned out OK too. The
obvious link for me was the very similar monograms these two teams have.
From there I extrapolated similar monograms for every team in the league
and included those in the teams’ most unique colours, to maximize
variety. Of course I let SF and KC stand out in the middle, and
generally kept NFC teams on the left and AFC on the right, with playoff
teams closer to the centre.</p>
<p><img src="img/2024-02-17-championship-posters/sblviii.png" class="image-full-width" /></p>
<h2 id="nba-finals-2">2024 NBA Finals</h2>
<p>Boston Celtics 4, Dallas Mavericks 1</p>
<p>“First ever all-‘*ic(k)(s)’ NBA finals match-up. Among five NBA teams
with ‘*ic(k)(s)’ names (Celtics, Knicks, Magic, Mavericks, Supersonics),
no pair had ever faced off in the finals before this year.”</p>
<p>The Mavericks’ ‘M’ fits into the Celtics’ shamrock well. The
background is half parquet for the Celtics and half a wavy pattern
inspired by the Mavericks’ infamous “trash bag” uniforms.</p>
<p><img src="img/2024-02-17-championship-posters/2024-nba-finals.png" class="image-full-width" /></p>
<h2 id="stanley-cup-finals-2">2024 Stanley Cup Finals</h2>
<p>Florida Panthers 4, Edmonton Oilers 3</p>
<p>“First all-‘*ers’ Stanley Cup final match-up outside the ’80s, when
the Oilers, Flyers, and Islanders all played each other.”</p>
<p>Panthers colours are surprisingly close to the old copper/red/navy
Oilers uniforms. While oil drips down from the top of the circle, the
sun rises from the bottom. The Panthers have used logos featuring the
sun before, plus they play in the city of Sunrise.</p>
