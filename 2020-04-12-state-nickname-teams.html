<!-- State Nickname Teams -->
<!-- 2020-04-12 -->
<p>For reasons I can’t quite explain, I find the nicknames of U. S. states pretty interesting. Maybe it’s because Canadian provinces don’t really have nicknames the same way—there are some well-known ones, like “The Island” (P. E. I.), “The Rock” (Newfoundland), and “La Belle Province” (Quebec), but they aren’t official, not every province has one, and they’re just not that cool. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_provincial_and_territorial_nicknames_in_Canada">Here’s a list</a> of nicknames of provinces and territories, but that’s not what this post is about. This post is about state nicknames. Every state except Wisconsin has an official one, and most states have a few additional descriptive, well-known, unofficial nicknames. There are a lot of teams, especially college teams, that use their state’s nickname either directly or as inspiration for their mascot; here are the ones I’ve found:</p>

<p>With these in mind, I thought it would be interesting to see how other state nicknames would translate to team names, logos, and uniform designs. I’ll add designs to this post as I finish them. My plan is to have primary designs focus on states’ official nicknames with special alternate designs for notable unofficial nicknames or aspects of the state not covered by the primary identity. I’m not going to work in any particular order.</p>
<p>Here are the ideas for teams I have so far, subject to change:</p>

<h2 id="florida-sarasota-shiners">FLORIDA: Sarasota Shiners</h2>
<p><em>February-April 2020</em></p>
<p>In a lot of cases I’ve chosen state capitals or largest cities to base these teams in, but that wasn’t the case here. I’m trying to avoid putting teams in cities that already have teams playing at the top level of the same sport, which ruled out the Miami and Tampa Bay areas. Tallahassee, the capital of Florida, would still be an option, but “Tallahassee Shiners” doesn’t have the same ring to it, and “Shiners” seemed better suited to Sarasota anyway.</p>
<p>When I first started thinking about state nicknames as team nicknames, I was a bit worried about how they would all translate, so, to play devil’s advocate, I tried to think of the least intimidating state nickname. While there are others I was forgetting, it was the Sunshine State that came to mind. Sunshine is not very intimidating (sorry Phoenix Suns) but then it occurred to me that I could alter it to “Shiners”, which sounds to me like a tough, old-school kind of hockey team, since “shiner” is slang for a black eye. Hence, the primary logo is a pun; it’s a hockey mask with a black eye, except the black eye is a bit of sunshine. The secondary logo, which appears on the shoulders of all three jerseys, depicts the state of Florida with a similar sunshine pattern centred on Sarasota on the Gulf Coast. Admittedly the geometry of this secondary logo was another part of the reason I chose Sarasota.</p>
<p><img src="img/state-nickname-teams/fl-primary.svg" style="width: 300px; height: 300px" /> <img src="img/state-nickname-teams/fl-secondary.svg" style="width: 300px; height: 300px" /></p>
<p>The alternate logo is a reference to Florida’s unofficial nickname, “Alligator State”.</p>
<p><img src="img/state-nickname-teams/fl-alt.svg" style="width: 500px; height: 500px" /></p>
<p>And, of course, the jerseys:</p>
<p><img src="img/state-nickname-teams/fl-uniforms.svg" style="width: 600px; height: 900" /></p>
<p>I played around with several different colour schemes, including yellow/orange/double green and yellow/orange/black/turquoise, but ultimately the cleaner look of yellow/orange/black prevailed. As you can see, I added green for the alligator on the alternate jersey, and I considered adding more throughout that jersey as well, but eventually decided to focus on team colours outside of the necessary green in the logo. The black base with orange and yellow gives it a strong <a href="http://www.sportslogos.net/logos/view/f26e97kyhdhn4m9v338hh7316/Vancouver_Canucks/1986/Dark_Uniform">’80s Canucks vibe</a>, but I think the colour scheme makes more sense for a Florida team than it did for a Vancouver team.</p>
