<!-- Things to Eat, See, and Do -->
<!-- 2023-01-22 -->
<p>Around the time I moved away from New York City, I compiled a list of
things to eat, see, and do there, as a reminder for myself when I
visited in the future, but also as a guide for anyone else I knew who
might be going. I’ve realized it would be useful to store similar
information for all the cities I visit. That’s what this list is. Along
with each destination other than Toronto, where I live now, and
Kitchener, where I grew up and my parents still live, I’ll list the last
time I visited, to give an idea of how dated my experience is. The idea
is to update this list over time instead of posting new lists in the
future.</p>
<h2 id="north-america">North America</h2>
<h3 id="canada">Canada</h3>
<h4 id="kitchener-waterloo-on">Kitchener-Waterloo, ON</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>La Cucina</em>: Really nice Italian in downtown Kitchener.</li>
<li><em>Lancaster Smokehouse</em>: My favourite restaurant in KW, they
do really solid southern-style barbeque. The pulled pork is my
recommendation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="montreal-qc-august-2024">Montreal, QC (August 2024)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Brit &amp; Chips</em>: They serve nice and crispy fish and chips
in a cool diner. The maple battered fish was good, but not as good as
the traditional version.</li>
<li><em>Satay Brothers Resto</em>: This Singaporean restaurant was
packed the night we were there, and we really enjoyed trying a variety
of dishes. The bao buns were a highlight.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ottawa-on-august-2024">Ottawa, ON (August 2024)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eat
<ul>
<li><em>Khao Thai</em>: Our best meal in Ottawa was at this Thai
restaurant in Byward Market.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>See
<ul>
<li><em>Royal Canadian Mint</em>: The Mint has a really cool tour where
you can see the factory floor where they make coins.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="toronto-on">Toronto, ON</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Burgers n’ Fries Forever</em>: Very good burgers and fries.</li>
<li><em>Little India</em>: A little more formal than some Indian
restaurants, they have excellent lamb vindaloo.</li>
<li><em>Matt’s Burger Lab</em>: Excellent burgers.</li>
<li><em>Milagro</em>: Slightly upscale Mexican close to the
Skydome.</li>
<li><em>Planta</em>: Vegan food that you wouldn’t guess was vegan. There
are a few locations but the Asian fusion one on Queen West is my
favourite.</li>
<li><em>Salad King</em>: Cheap Thai and other southeast Asian food,
there are a couple locations.</li>
<li><em>Salt and Tobacco</em>: They make really crispy and flavourful
pizza in a wood oven. I was there on a cold winter night and the aroma
when I opened the door to the restaurant was heavenly.</li>
<li><em>Sizzler Kabab</em>: My favourite butter chicken, with big chunks
of meat and lots of flavour. And delicious garlic naan slathered in
butter.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="united-states">United States</h3>
<h4 id="chicago-il-october-2024">Chicago, IL (October 2024)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Pizzeria Due</em>: A second location for the famous Pizzeria
Uno, located one block away. The deep dish and tavern-style pizza were
both delicious.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="miami-fl-may-2019">Miami, FL (May 2019)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eat
<ul>
<li><em>El Mago de las Fritas</em>: A little out of the way, but it’s
worth the trip for the Cuban <em>fritas</em>, a version of
hamburgers.</li>
<li><em>El Rey de las Fritas</em>: On Calle Ocho, walking distance from
the baseball stadium, they serve delicious fritas.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>See
<ul>
<li><em>Vizcaya Museum &amp; Gardens</em>: This old mansion was turned
into a museum with a beautiful garden and ocean views.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do
<ul>
<li>You can walk over the causeway from downtown Miami to Miami Beach.
It takes a while and the sun can be hot, but it’s really cool to walk
across the water and see all the houses along the way.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="nashville-tn-march-2023">Nashville, TN (March 2023)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eat
<ul>
<li><em>Biscuit Love</em>: Best biscuits I’ve ever had. They’re flaky
like a croissant, but still distinctly biscuits. Try the chronic bacon
too.</li>
<li><em>Cheap Charlie’s Taco Shop</em>: Best tacos I’ve ever had, served
out of a trailer in a gas station parking lot.</li>
<li><em>DeSano Pizza Bakery</em>: It’s weird to say that the best pizza
you’ve ever had is at a chain in Nashville, Tennessee. I was skeptical
too until I tried it.</li>
<li><em>Hattie B’s Hot Chicken</em>: Best chicken tenders I’ve ever
had.</li>
<li><em>Martin’s Bar-B-Que Joint</em>: Best ribs I’d ever had, until I
went to Peg Leg Porker. Tender but not fatty or greasy.</li>
<li><em>Peg Leg Porker BBQ</em>: Everything I liked about Martin’s ribs,
but even better.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>See
<ul>
<li><em>The Listening Room</em>: Pretty modern venue that books good
shows, with a variety of singer-songwriters. The food is good too.</li>
<li><em>Station Inn</em>: A dive bar with good music, especially
bluegrass. My favourite show in Nashville was the bluegrass drop-in they
hold every Sunday night.</li>
<li><em>Hatch Show Print</em>: Take a tour of the print shop to see how
Nashville concert posters are made.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do
<ul>
<li><em>Korean War Veterans Memorial Bridge</em> or <em>John
Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge</em>: Walking over either bridge gives a
good view of the city skyline.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="new-york-ny-june-2022">New York, NY (June 2022)</h4>
<p><a href="/2019-03-08-things-to-see-and-do-in-nyc">See my separate
post on NYC.</a></p>
<h4 id="syracuse-ny-june-2024">Syracuse, NY (June 2024)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Dinosaur Bar-B-Que</em>: Delicious southern barbeque in central
New York state; I’m partial to the pulled pork.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="trinidad-and-tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</h3>
<h4 id="trinidad-december-2024">Trinidad (December 2024)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eat
<ul>
<li><em>Jenny’s on the Boulevard</em>: I didn’t really understand Trini
Chinese food until I went to Jenny’s. It’s more flavourful than what
I’ve had anywhere else.</li>
<li><em>Swaggy’s Roti</em>: I had their stew chicken and it was
delicious.</li>
<li><em>Wings Roti Shop</em>: You get to choose from a variety of veggie
and meat curries, eaten with roti. All that I tried were good but the
pumpkin and mango stand out.</li>
<li>You can’t visit Trinidad without trying <em>doubles</em>. This is
the most iconic Trini street food and consists of two <em>bara</em>
(fried bread), <em>chana</em> (curried chickpeas), and lots of different
sauces as toppings. They are incredibly delicious. Proper procedure is
to wash your hands (even doubles carts will provide some water to wash
up), order, eat, and then pay after you’re done eating. Just a few will
fill you, and they are cheap at about six TT dollars apiece.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>See
<ul>
<li><em>Queen’s Park Savannah</em>: This large park is in the middle of
the world’s largest roundabout. It has carnival facilities, an area for
food stalls, and other attractions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do
<ul>
<li><em>Ariapita Avenue</em>: This is the key nightlife street in Port
of Spain. You can have a nice self-guided food tour by going to the food
trucks on the Savannah and then visiting the Avenue.</li>
<li><em>Las Cuevas</em>: Of the beaches I’ve been to in Trinidad, Las
Cuevas was my favourite. It’s a little farther than Maracas, which is
the most popular beach on the island, but it’s calmer and has some cool
caves along the beach. You can spend a day driving up to Maracas and Las
Cuevas, with a stop for bake and shark for lunch on Maracas Beach.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tobago-june-2023">Tobago (June 2023)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Crusty Crab</em>: I wasn’t too fond of crab and dumplings, which
Tobago is famous for, but their stew chicken, steamed fish, ground
provisions, and beans were all delicious.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="south-america">South America</h2>
<h3 id="brazil">Brazil</h3>
<h4 id="rio-de-janeiro-december-2023">Rio de Janeiro (December
2023)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eat
<ul>
<li><em>Churrascaria Palace</em>: Really excellent Brazilian barbeque
near Copacabana Beach. They just keep bringing different meats, but the
salad bar is full of delicious dishes as well.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>See
<ul>
<li><em>Catedral Metropolitana de São Sebastião</em>: This cathedral was
like nothing I’d seen before. The outside is hideous, but the inside is
an awe-inspiring surprise.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chile">Chile</h3>
<h4 id="san-pedro-de-atacama-december-2023">San Pedro de Atacama
(December 2023)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eat
<ul>
<li><em>Ckunza Tilar</em>: We didn’t have any bad meals in San Pedro,
but Ckunza Tilar was the best value. Their preset lunch menu was great
(including the falafel!) and they serve dinner as well.</li>
<li>Many restaurants serve the local specialty <em>pil pil</em>, in
which chicken or seafood are served in a spicy, creamy garlic sauce with
crispy potatoes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>See
<ul>
<li><em>Valle de la Luna</em>: I think this is where we had the most
incredible views of our honeymoon. Be sure to take a tour; it’s not very
far from San Pedro. There’s a great lookout point to watch the sunset
from.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do
<ul>
<li><em>Lagunas Escondidas</em>: The hidden lagoons are saltier than the
Dead Sea, so you float right on top, in the middle of the desert, with a
view of the Andes in the distance. Swimming there was like something
from a dream.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="santiago-december-2023">Santiago (December 2023)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eat
<ul>
<li><em>Chipe Libre</em>: The menu has both Peruvian and Chilean food,
and everything we ate there was good. They’re known for the many
varieties of pisco that they serve.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>See
<ul>
<li><em>Catedral Metropolitano de Santiago de Chile</em>: Situated on
Plaza de Armas, the cathedral is huge and beautiful.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do
<ul>
<li><em>San Cristóbal Hill</em>: Take the cable car to the top of the
hill for an amazing view of the city.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="colombia">Colombia</h3>
<h4 id="bogotá-august-2023">Bogotá (August 2023)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eat
<ul>
<li><em>Azúl Restaurante</em>: At lunchtime, this place is full of
locals enjoying the preset menu. We would each get a drink, soup, meat,
rice, plantains, and a side of beans or pasta for COP 12 000.</li>
<li><em>Restaurante Balcones de la Candelaria</em>: It’s a little bit
tourist-y, but the hearty soup and giant tamale were excellent.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>See
<ul>
<li><em>Botero Museum</em>: I didn’t really appreciate Botero’s work
until seeing so much of it in Colombia. This museum is free and shows
you Botero’s influences and growth as an artist.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do
<ul>
<li><em>Monserrate</em>: Take the cable car up Monserrate for the best
view of Bogotá. The city itself is at high altitude, but going up
Monserrate makes it even more noticeable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don’t
<ul>
<li><em>Casa Museo Quinta de Bolívar</em>: Don’t bother visiting this
reconstruction of a house Simón Bolívar lived in. There’s not much to
see.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="medellín-august-2023">Medellín (August 2023)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eat
<ul>
<li>I can’t give a specific location, but we drank <em>guarapo</em> from
a stand on the street and it was fantastic. It’s a drink made by juicing
sugar cane and limes together.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>See
<ul>
<li><em>Centro Comercial Palacio Nacional</em>: The former palace of
justice is now a shopping mall, but it retains its opulent
interior.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do
<ul>
<li>Take a ride on one of the cable cars that form part of the city’s
public transportation network. They’re designed to help people commute
from the mountainous suburbs, but they also give a great view.</li>
<li><em>Guatapé</em>: Take a day trip to see the rock of Guatapé and
climb the stairs to the peak. Tours also stop in the town of Guatapé,
the most colourful in the Americas, where each building is required by
law to feature either bright colours or a mural.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="perú">Perú</h3>
<h4 id="lima-january-2024">Lima (January 2024)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Barra Maretazo</em>: We found this place near our hotel, open on
New Year’s Day. It is tourist-y but the traditional Peruvian food is
well-executed.</li>
<li>Most restaurants serve <em>chicha morada</em>, a sweet purple corn
juice. You wouldn’t know from the taste that it’s made of corn and it’s
really delicious.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="europe">Europe</h2>
<h3 id="germany">Germany</h3>
<h4 id="berlin-october-2022">Berlin (October 2022)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Brammibal’s Donuts</em>: Delicious vegan doughnuts.</li>
<li><em>Shakespeare and Sons</em>: Bagels and books.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spain">Spain</h3>
<h4 id="barcelona-october-2022">Barcelona (October 2022)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Amigo doner kebab y pizzería</em>: Delicious doner not far from
Park Güell.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="granada-october-2022">Granada (October 2022)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Grana Pizza</em>: Delicious and cheap pizza.</li>
<li><em>Jerusalem Restaurant</em>: Best falafel I’ve ever had, and super
cheap.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="africa">Africa</h2>
<h3 id="kenya">Kenya</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you’re staying for a longer time, it’s worth setting up Mpesa, an
electronic payment system that has mostly replaced cash. You’ll need a
SIM card and you’ll have to find a way to transfer money to the account.
I used a debit card to put money in my Wise account, then transferred
from there to Mpesa.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="namibia">Namibia</h3>
<h4 id="sossusvlei-march-2025">Sossusvlei (March 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Big Daddy Dune</em>: If you are headed to Sossusvlei, it is most
likely to see Deadvlei, but for me the best view of Deadvlei was from
the top of Big Daddy Dune. Climbing up sand is hard work, but there’s a
big payoff at the peak and you can get back down very quickly, as the
sand lets you slide right down.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="swakopmund-march-2025">Swakopmund (March 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eat
<ul>
<li><em>Farmhouse Deli</em>: This is one of a line of restaurants on the
waterfront of Swakopmund, but the best thing I ate in Namibia was their
oryx ragu.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do
<ul>
<li><em>Sandwich Harbour</em>: On one side there are dunes as far as the
eye can see and on the other you overlook the south Atlantic. It is
totally worth a tour that will take you for a ride up the dunes, which
is known as the “Namibian roller coaster”.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="south-africa">South Africa</h3>
<h4 id="cape-town-march-2025">Cape Town (March 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eat
<ul>
<li><em>Bihari</em>: Nice Indian restaurant in a hotel.</li>
<li><em>The Black Sheep</em>: Very well done food, from a variety of
cultures. I had pappardelle with braised beef and mushrooms.</li>
<li><em>Eastern Food Bazaar</em>: A series of counters with different
south and east Asian food. Huge portions for cheap.</li>
<li><em>GOLD Restaurant</em>: Many dishes from across Africa, in
combination with dancing, singing, and drumming.</li>
<li><em>Tadka</em>: Nice Indian restaurant. One of Cape Town’s rolling
blackouts started while we were there, which made for an interesting
atmosphere.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>See
<ul>
<li><em>Table Mountain</em>: Take the cable car to the top for
incredible views on all sides.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do
<ul>
<li><em>Ocean Wonder</em>: Ride around the harbour in a very small boat
to get up-close views of local wildlife.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tanzania">Tanzania</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you’re going to Zanzibar, avoid Dar es Salaam and the ferry
terminal, which is total bedlam. Getting a flight from Dar es Salaam
airport to Zanzibar is about the same price and you can skip going to
the city altogether.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="zanzibar-march-2025">Zanzibar (March 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Maru Maru</em>: We were not enamoured with the restaurant
options in Zanzibar, but in terms of quality and value, Maru Maru
Hotel’s rooftop restaurant was the best we found. My favourite dish was
the Zanzibar-style chicken curry.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="asia">Asia</h2>
<h3 id="china">China</h3>
<h4 id="hong-kong-june-2025">Hong Kong (June 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eat
<ul>
<li><em>Dim Sum Here</em>: All the dim sum we tried at this busy spot in
Kowloon was excellent.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>See
<ul>
<li><em>Peak Galleria</em>: If you’re taking the tram up to Victoria
Peak, they’ll try to sell you a ticket to the Peak Tower observation
deck. Don’t buy it. Instead, go next door to the Peak Galleria shopping
mall and there’s an observation deck with just as good a view on the top
floor, for free.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="macao-june-2025">Macao (June 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li>See
<ul>
<li><em>Cotai Strip</em>: We started out visiting casinos around the
Grand Lisboa, in mainland Macao. We spent too much time there and didn’t
have enough time in the Cotai Strip, which is where the real spectacle
is. The Venetian, Parisian, and Londoner are highlights. If coming from
the mainland, you can take a free shuttle there from the Sands.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="indonesia">Indonesia</h3>
<h4 id="bali-july-2025">Bali (July 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Cream &amp; Crumble</em>: This is a new kiosk selling delicious,
buttery cookies on the street in Canggu.</li>
<li><em>Fat Chow</em>: Even though it’s located down a side road, this
is a busy place and you may have to wait for a table, but they served us
excellent Thai and Vietnamese food.</li>
<li><em>Living Tree Bali Cafe</em>: The breakfast dishes are delicious
too, but the highlight was the best nasi goreng we ate in Indonesia.
It’s a small nad busy place, so it can be hard to get a table, but it’s
well worth it.</li>
<li><em>Ricky D’s</em>: Their signature chicken schnitzel sandwich is
crispy, savoury, and delicious. They use soft, spongy sandwich bread
which I really enjoyed.</li>
<li><em>Tiga Canggu</em>: Their English breakfast was my favourite
brunch in Bali, or anywhere else during our six months of
travelling.</li>
<li><em>Vietnamese Minnie Warung</em>: The food is fresh and delicious,
including Vietnamese and Indonesian dishes. The mie goreng was very
good.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="nusa-lembongan-july-2025">Nusa Lembongan (July 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Pondok Baruna Warung</em>: This was the best restaurant we found
in Lembongan. They serve delicious and fresh local food. I especially
liked the nasi campur.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="japan">Japan</h3>
<h4 id="kyoto-september-2025">Kyoto (September 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>The Smile</em>: After walking through some dark residential
streets to find this cafe, we were stunned by how delicious their
chocolate brownie with ice cream was. It was very rich, with high
quality chocolate.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tokyo-september-2025">Tokyo (September 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li>See
<ul>
<li><em>Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building Observatory</em>: The
local government offers a free 45th floor viewing deck to see Tokyo from
above.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do
<ul>
<li><em>Ameyoko Market</em>: This mraket has loads of different food
options and cheap clothes and souvenirs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</h3>
<h4 id="almaty-june-2025">Almaty (June 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Chef and Sweets</em>: This Indian restaurant was one of our
favourites in Central Asia. The tandoori chicken was tender and
flavourful and the vegetable biryani was packed with delicious roasted
veggies.</li>
<li><em>Lanzhou</em>: The tsomyan lagman with chicken and mushrooms had
tender, chewy noodles with an amazing umami mushroom flavour. They have
lots of locations in Almaty and Astana.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="malaysia">Malaysia</h3>
<h4 id="kuala-lumpur-june-2025">Kuala Lumpur (June 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Hong Kee Claypot Chicken</em>: Chicken and rice are cooked
together over fire on the side of the street in Chinatown. The chicken
is tender and the rice is aromatic, with some crispy pieces where it’s
burnt against the side of the pot.</li>
<li><em>Roast Duckking</em>: Chicken rice is an iconic southeast Asian
dish and they have an excellent rendition, plus duck rice. The
restaurnat is located in an extensive underground food court, where the
other stands are worth exploring as well.</li>
<li><em>Valentine Roti</em>: They make a delicious roti jantan and roti
telur, which are fried crispy on a flattop grill with egg inside.
Dipping the roti in the accompanying daal is delicious, and their
tandoori chicken is perfectly tender as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="maldives">Maldives</h3>
<h4 id="malé-june-2025">Malé (June 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Fish Market</em>: The fish market on the north coast of the city
smells like you might expect, but it was amazing to see the skill of the
butchers there. Also, if you walk out onto the jetty where the fishing
boats park, you can see huge stingrays in the water as they eat the
dropped scraps.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="philippines">Philippines</h3>
<ul>
<li>You’re going to need a lot of cash. Even restaurants often only take
cash.</li>
<li>Flights board on time or even early! We’ve never seen such punctual
flights.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="manila-july-2025">Manila (July 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Kazuko Ramenba</em>: The ramen noodles were perfectly chewy and
the broth was rich and umami.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="south-korea">South Korea</h3>
<h4 id="seoul-september-2025">Seoul (September 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>BHC Chicken</em>: This is a big chain but they made the best
Korean fried chicken we ate during a week in Seoul.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="taiwan">Taiwan</h3>
<h4 id="taipei-june-2025">Taipei (June 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eat
<ul>
<li><em>Crispy Milk Donuts</em>: We stayed on the same block as this
tiny corner outlet and got their doughnuts at least once a day. Usha
doesn’t normally like doughnuts at all, but craved these, as they are so
light and crispy and covered in milk powder, which is delicious but not
too sweet.</li>
<li><em>Din Tai Fung</em>: This is an iconic dim sum restaurant in
Taiwan and it lived up to the hype! Highlights include the soup
dumplings, spicy noodles, and the sweet taro dumplings. They have
locations in many countries, but I’ve heard it’s best in Taiwan.</li>
<li><em>Raohe Street Night Market</em>: Of four night markets we visited
in Taipei, this was the largest and our favourite. We tried so much
delicious street food plus enjoyed the large temple by the
entrance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do
<ul>
<li><em>Elephant Mountain</em>: Hike up the mountain on a huge set of
stone steps. It doesn’t cover a lot of distance, but the still, humid
air can make it difficult. Still, it gives the best view we saw of
Taipei 101 plus it’s accessible by subway.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="thailand">Thailand</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most places only accept cash, but luckily there are lots of currency
exchanges around with good rates for US dollars.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="chiang-mai-july-2025">Chiang Mai (July 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Anusarn Market</em>: This night market has lots of souvenirs and
delicious, cheap food. It’s a great place to hang out in the
evening.</li>

<ul>
<li>Eat
<ul>
<li><em>Tiki Tee’s</em>: Located just off Karon Beach, we dined there
twice and every dish was a hit. These were our best meals in Thailand,
and were offered for a great price. They really understood how to
balance the flavours and the presentation of the food was
immaculate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do
<ul>
<li>Try to take the Smart Bus to and from the airport if you can,
because taxis and Grabs can be very expensive.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</h3>
<ul>
<li>Carry at least enough cash for a meal. Many places take credit card,
but even some established restaurants don’t, so it’s better to be on the
safe side.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bukhara-may-2025">Bukhara (May 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Joy Lounge</em>: There are only so many restaurants in Old
Bukhara, but this was the best we found. Nice ambience and the food was
better seasoned than other places, including the pumpkin manti.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="samarkand-may-2025">Samarkand (May 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eat
<ul>
<li><em>Arirang</em>: This was the most flavourful food we had in
Central Asia. They served delicious Korean dishes and have a prime
location right next to Registan Square.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>See
<ul>
<li><em>Seven Lakes, Tajikistan</em>: These are some very beautiful
blue-green Alpine lakes in the Fann Mountains just across the border.
You can take a day trip from Samarkand, but make sure you book with a
reliable tour company.</li>

<h4 id="da-nang-august-2025">Da Nang (August 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Gordon’s New York Pizza</em>: A New Yorker moved to Da Nang and
worked his way up from a stand at a night market to several restaurant
locations serving delicious NY-style pizza.</li>
<li><em>Miss Nhi</em>: Now run by a third generation, they serve
delicious Vietnamese food and local favourites.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ha-long-bay-august-2025">Ha Long Bay (August 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>La Casta Cruises</em>: There is a wide range of cruises
available in Ha Long Bay, but we were very happy with ours. It was air
conditioned and had a great buffet on board, making it much more
luxurious than some other companies.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="hanoi-august-2025">Hanoi (August 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Met</em>: They have different locations around the country, but
the one we went to in Hanoi’s Old Quarter made my favourite Vietnamese
meal of the trip.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ho-chi-minh-city-august-2025">Ho Chi Minh City (August
2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Oasis Cafe</em>: The food was good but the main draw was the
huge koi pond with booths sunken into it to eat in. You can have fish
swimming right by you as you eat. It’s great for pictures.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="middle-east">Middle East</h2>
<h3 id="jordan">Jordan</h3>
<ul>
<li>You should get the Jordan Pass, which includes the visa fee,
entrance fees to Petra and Wadi Rum, and loads of other
attractions.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="amman-april-2025">Amman (April 2025)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Sufra</em>: They kept bringing us fresh pita to eat with the
delicious, smoky muttabal and chicken and lamb stews.</li>
<li><em>Turkish Restaurant</em>: The name is all in Arabic on Google
Maps, but it’s right on highway 15 very close to the airport. All the
food was incredibly delicious and cheap. The muttabal and Turkish salad
were highlights.</li>
