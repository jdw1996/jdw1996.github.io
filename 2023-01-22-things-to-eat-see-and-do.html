<!-- Things to Eat, See, and Do -->
<!-- 2023-01-22 -->
<p>Around the time I moved away from New York City, I compiled a list of things to eat, see, and do there, as a reminder for myself when I visited in the future, but also as a guide for anyone else I knew who might be going. I’ve realized it would be useful to store similar information for all the cities I visit. That’s what this list is. Along with each destination other than Toronto, where I live now, and Kitchener, where I grew up and my parents still live, I’ll list the last time I visited, to give an idea of how dated my experience is. The idea is to update this list over time instead of posting new lists in the future.</p>
<h2 id="north-america">North America</h2>
<h3 id="canada">Canada</h3>
<h4 id="kitchener-waterloo">Kitchener-Waterloo</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>La Cucina</em>: Really nice Italian in downtown Kitchener.</li>
<li><em>Lancaster Smokehouse</em>: My favourite restaurant in KW, they do really solid southern-style barbeque. The pulled pork is my recommendation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="toronto">Toronto</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Burgers n’ Fries Forever</em>: Very good burgers and fries.</li>
<li><em>Matt’s Burger Lab</em>: Excellent burgers.</li>
<li><em>Milagro</em>: Slightly upscale Mexican close to the Skydome.</li>
<li><em>Planta</em>: Vegan food that you wouldn’t guess was vegan. There are a few locations but the Asian fusion one on Queen West is my favourite.</li>
<li><em>Salad King</em>: Cheap Thai and other southeast Asian food, there are a couple locations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="united-states">United States</h3>
<h4 id="nashville-march-2022">Nashville (March 2022)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eat
<ul>
<li><em>Biscuit Love</em>: Best biscuits I’ve ever had. They’re flaky like a croissant, but still distinctly biscuits. Try the chronic bacon too.</li>
<li><em>Cheap Charlie’s Taco Shop</em>: Best tacos I’ve ever had, served out of a trailer in a gas station parking lot.</li>
<li><em>DeSano Pizza Bakery</em>: It’s weird to say that the best pizza you’ve ever had is at a chain in Nashville, Tennessee. I was skeptical too until I tried it.</li>
<li><em>Hattie B’s Hot Chicken</em>: Best chicken tenders I’ve ever had.</li>
<li><em>Martin’s Bar-B-Que Joint</em>: Best ribs I’ve ever had. Tender but not fatty or greasy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>See
<ul>
<li><em>The Listening Room</em>: Pretty modern venue that books good shows, with a variety of singer-songwriters. The food is good too.</li>
<li><em>Station Inn</em>: A dive bar with good music, especially bluegrass. My favourite show in Nashville was the bluegrass drop-in they hold every Sunday night.</li>
<li><em>Hatch Show Print</em>: Take a tour of the print shop to see how Nashville concert posters are made.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do
<ul>
<li><em>Korean War Veterans Memorial Bridge</em> or <em>John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge</em>: Walking over either bridge gives a good view of the city skyline.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Eat

<li><em>The Black Sheep</em>: Very well done food, from a variety of cultures. I had pappardelle with braised beef and mushrooms.</li>

<li><em>GOLD Restaurant</em>: Many dishes from across Africa, in combination with dancing, singing, and drumming.</li>
<li><em>Tadka</em>: Nice Indian restaurant. One of Cape Town’s rolling blackouts started while we were there, which made for an interesting atmosphere.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>See
<ul>

</ul></li>
<li>Do
