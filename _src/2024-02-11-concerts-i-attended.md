<!-- Concerts I Attended -->
<!-- 2024-02-11 -->

I've written posts before about sporting events I've attended, including [this one which I'll keep updating with future events](/2023-01-28-sporting-events-i-attended.html).
Similarly I've been tracking concerts I've attended since I moved to New York City in the summer of 2019, so I'll track those here.
