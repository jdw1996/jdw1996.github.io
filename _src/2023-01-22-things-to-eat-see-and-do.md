<!-- Things to Eat, See, and Do -->
<!-- 2023-01-22 -->

Around the time I moved away from New York City, I compiled a list of things to eat, see, and do there, as a reminder for myself when I visited in the future, but also as a guide for anyone else I knew who might be going.
I've realized it would be useful to store similar information for all the cities I visit.
That's what this list is.
Along with each destination other than Toronto, where I live now, and Kitchener, where I grew up and my parents still live, I'll list the last time I visited, to give an idea of how dated my experience is.
The idea is to update this list over time instead of posting new lists in the future.

## North America

### Canada

#### Kitchener-Waterloo

- **La Cucina**: Really nice Italian in downtown Kitchener.
- **Lancaster Smokehouse**: My favourite restaurant in KW, they do really solid southern-style barbeque. The pulled pork is my recommendation.

#### Toronto

- **Burgers n' Fries Forever**: Very good burgers and fries.
- **Matt's Burger Lab**: Excellent burgers.
- **Milagro**: Slightly upscale Mexican close to the Skydome.
- **Planta**: Vegan food that you wouldn't guess was vegan. There are a few locations but the Asian fusion one on Queen West is my favourite.
- **Salad King**: Cheap Thai and other southeast Asian food, there are a couple locations.

### United States

#### Nashville (March 2022)

- Eat
  - **Biscuit Love**: Best biscuits I've ever had. They're flaky like a croissant, but still distinctly biscuits. Try the chronic bacon too.
  - **Cheap Charlie's Taco Shop**: Best tacos I've ever had, served out of a trailer in a gas station parking lot.
  - **DeSano Pizza Bakery**: It's weird to say that the best pizza you've ever had is at a chain in Nashville, Tennessee. I was skeptical too until I tried it.
  - **Hattie B's Hot Chicken**: Best chicken tenders I've ever had.
  - **Martin's Bar-B-Que Joint**: Best ribs I've ever had. Tender but not fatty or greasy.
- See
  - **The Listening Room**: Pretty modern venue that books good shows, with a variety of singer-songwriters. The food is good too.
  - **Station Inn**: A dive bar with good music, especially bluegrass. My favourite show in Nashville was the bluegrass drop-in they hold every Sunday night.
  - **Hatch Show Print**: Take a tour of the print shop to see how Nashville concert posters are made.
- Do
  - **Korean War Veterans Memorial Bridge** or **John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge**: Walking over either bridge gives a good view of the city skyline.

#### New York City (June 2022)

## Europe

### Germany

#### Berlin (October 2022)

- **Brammibal's Donuts**: Delicious vegan doughnuts.
- **Shakespeare and Sons**: Bagels and books.

### Spain

#### Barcelona (October 2022)

- **Amigo doner kebab y pizzería**: Delicious doner not far from Park Güell.

#### Granada (October 2022)

- **Grana Pizza**: Delicious and cheap pizza.
- **Jerusalem Restaurant**: Best falafel I've ever had, and super cheap.

## Africa

### South Africa

#### Cape Town (October-November 2022)

- Eat
  - **Bihari**: Nice Indian restaurant in a hotel.
  - **The Black Sheep**: Very well done food, from a variety of cultures. I had pappardelle with braised beef and mushrooms.
  - **Eastern Food Bazaar**: A series of counters with different south and east Asian food. Huge portions for cheap.
  - **GOLD Restaurant**: Many dishes from across Africa, in combination with dancing, singing, and drumming.
  - **Tadka**: Nice Indian restaurant. One of Cape Town's rolling blackouts started while we were there, which made for an interesting atmosphere.
- See
  - **Table Mountain**: Take the cable car to the top for incredible views on all sides.
- Do
  - **Ocean Wonder**: Ride around the harbour in a very small boat to get up-close views of local wildlife.
