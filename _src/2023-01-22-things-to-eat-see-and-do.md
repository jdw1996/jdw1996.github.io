<!-- Things to Eat, See, and Do -->
<!-- 2023-01-22 -->

Around the time I moved away from New York City, I compiled a list of things to eat, see, and do there, as a reminder for myself when I visited in the future, but also as a guide for anyone else I knew who might be going.
I've realized it would be useful to store similar information for all the cities I visit.
That's what this list is.
Along with each destination other than Toronto, where I live now, and Kitchener, where I grew up and my parents still live, I'll list the last time I visited, to give an idea of how dated my experience is.
The idea is to update this list over time instead of posting new lists in the future.

## North America

### Canada

#### Kitchener-Waterloo

- _La Cucina_: Really nice Italian in downtown Kitchener.
- _Lancaster Smokehouse_: My favourite restaurant in KW, they do really solid southern-style barbeque. The pulled pork is my recommendation.

#### Toronto

- _Burgers n' Fries Forever_: Very good burgers and fries.
- _Little India_: A little more formal than some Indian restaurants, they have excellent lamb vindaloo.
- _Matt's Burger Lab_: Excellent burgers.
- _Milagro_: Slightly upscale Mexican close to the Skydome.
- _Planta_: Vegan food that you wouldn't guess was vegan. There are a few locations but the Asian fusion one on Queen West is my favourite.
- _Salad King_: Cheap Thai and other southeast Asian food, there are a couple locations.
- _Sizzler Kabab_: My favourite butter chicken, with big chunks of meat and lots of flavour. And delicious garlic naan slathered in butter.

### United States

#### Nashville (March 2023)

- Eat
  - _Biscuit Love_: Best biscuits I've ever had. They're flaky like a croissant, but still distinctly biscuits. Try the chronic bacon too.
  - _Cheap Charlie's Taco Shop_: Best tacos I've ever had, served out of a trailer in a gas station parking lot.
  - _DeSano Pizza Bakery_: It's weird to say that the best pizza you've ever had is at a chain in Nashville, Tennessee. I was skeptical too until I tried it.
  - _Hattie B's Hot Chicken_: Best chicken tenders I've ever had.
  - _Martin's Bar-B-Que Joint_: Best ribs I'd ever had, until I went to Peg Leg Porker. Tender but not fatty or greasy.
  - _Peg Leg Porker BBQ_: Everything I liked about Martin's ribs, but even better.
- See
  - _The Listening Room_: Pretty modern venue that books good shows, with a variety of singer-songwriters. The food is good too.
  - _Station Inn_: A dive bar with good music, especially bluegrass. My favourite show in Nashville was the bluegrass drop-in they hold every Sunday night.
  - _Hatch Show Print_: Take a tour of the print shop to see how Nashville concert posters are made.
- Do
  - _Korean War Veterans Memorial Bridge_ or _John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge_: Walking over either bridge gives a good view of the city skyline.

#### New York City (June 2022)

[See my separate post on NYC.](/2019-03-08-things-to-see-and-do-in-nyc)

### Trinidad and Tobago (July 2023)

#### Trinidad

- Eat
  - _Wings Roti Shop_: You get to choose from a variety of veggie and meat curries, eaten with roti. All that I tried were good but the pumpkin and mango stand out.
  - _Swaggy's Roti_: I had their stew chicken and it was delicious.
  - You can't visit Trinidad without trying _doubles_. This is the most iconic Trini street food and consists of two _bara_ (fried bread), _chana_ (curried chickpeas), and lots of different sauces as toppings. They are incredibly delicious. Proper procedure is to wash your hands (even doubles carts will provide some water to wash up), order, eat, and then pay after you're done eating. Just a few will fill you, and they are cheap at about six TT dollars apiece.
- See
  - _Ariapita Avenue_: This is the key nightlife street in Port of Spain. You can have a nice self-guided food tour by going to the food trucks on the Savannah and then visiting the Avenue.
  - _Queen's Park Savannah_: This large park is in the middle of the world's largest roundabout. It has carnival facilities, an area for food stalls, and other attractions.

#### Tobago

- _Crusty Crab_: I wasn't too fond of crab and dumplings, which Tobago is famous for, but their stew chicken, steamed fish, ground provisions, and beans were all delicious.

## South America

### Brazil

#### Rio de Janeiro (December 2023)

- Eat
  - _Churrascaria Palace_: Really excellent Brazilian barbeque near Copacabana Beach. They just keep bringing different meats, but the salad bar is full of delicious dishes as well.
- See
  - _Catedral Metropolitana de São Sebastião_: This cathedral was like nothing I'd seen before. The outside is hideous, but the inside is an awe-inspiring surprise.

### Chile

#### San Pedro de Atacama (December 2023)

- Eat
  - _Ckunza Tilar_: We didn't have any bad meals in San Pedro, but Ckunza Tilar was the best value. Their preset lunch menu was great (including the falafel!) and they serve dinner as well.
  - Many restaurants serve the local specialty _pil pil_, in which chicken or seafood are served in a spicy, creamy garlic sauce with crispy potatoes.
- See
  - _Valle de la Luna_: I think this is where we had the most incredible views of our honeymoon. Be sure to take a tour; it's not very far from San Pedro. There's a great lookout point to watch the sunset from.
- Do
  - _Lagunas Escondidas_: The hidden lagoons are saltier than the Dead Sea, so you float right on top, in the middle of the desert, with a view of the Andes in the distance. Swimming there was like something from a dream.

#### Santiago (December 2023)

- Eat
  - _Chipe Libre_: The menu has both Peruvian and Chilean food, and everything we ate there was good. They're known for the many varieties of pisco that they serve.
- See
  - _Catedral Metropolitano de Santiago de Chile_: Situated on Plaza de Armas, the cathedral is huge and beautiful.
- Do
  - _San Cristóbal Hill_: Take the cable car to the top of the hill for an amazing view of the city.

### Colombia

#### Bogotá (August 2023)

- Eat
  - _Azúl Restaurante_: At lunchtime, this place is full of locals enjoying the preset menu. We would each get a drink, soup, meat, rice, plantains, and a side of beans or pasta for COP 12 000.
  - _Restaurante Balcones de la Candelaria_: It's a little bit tourist-y, but the hearty soup and giant tamale were excellent.
- See
  - _Botero Museum_: I didn't really appreciate Botero's work until seeing so much of it in Colombia. This museum is free and shows you Botero's influences and growth as an artist.
- Do
  - _Monserrate_: Take the cable car up Monserrate for the best view of Bogotá. The city itself is at high altitude, but going up Monserrate makes it even more noticeable.
- Don't
  - _Casa Museo Quinta de Bolívar_: Don't bother visiting this reconstruction of a house Simón Bolívar lived in. There's not much to see.

#### Medellín (August 2023)

- Eat
  - I can't give a specific location, but we drank _guarapo_ from a stand on the street and it was fantastic. It's a drink made by juicing sugar cane and limes together.
- See
  - _Centro Comercial Palacio Nacional_: The former palace of justice is now a shopping mall, but it retains its opulent interior.
- Do
  - Take a ride on one of the cable cars that form part of the city's public transportation network. They're designed to help people commute from the mountainous suburbs, but they also give a great view.
  - _Guatapé_: Take a day trip to see the rock of Guatapé and climb the stairs to the peak. Tours also stop in the town of Guatapé, the most colourful in the Americas, where each building is required by law to feature either bright colours or a mural.

### Perú

#### Lima (January 2024)

- _Barra Maretazo_: We found this place near our hotel, open on New Year's Day. It is tourist-y but the traditional Peruvian food is well-executed.
- Most restaurants serve _chicha morada_, a sweet purple corn juice. You wouldn't know from the taste that it's made of corn and it's really delicious.

## Europe

### Germany

#### Berlin (October 2022)

- _Brammibal's Donuts_: Delicious vegan doughnuts.
- _Shakespeare and Sons_: Bagels and books.

### Spain

#### Barcelona (October 2022)

- _Amigo doner kebab y pizzería_: Delicious doner not far from Park Güell.

#### Granada (October 2022)

- _Grana Pizza_: Delicious and cheap pizza.
- _Jerusalem Restaurant_: Best falafel I've ever had, and super cheap.

## Africa

### South Africa

#### Cape Town (October-November 2022)

- Eat
  - _Bihari_: Nice Indian restaurant in a hotel.
  - _The Black Sheep_: Very well done food, from a variety of cultures. I had pappardelle with braised beef and mushrooms.
  - _Eastern Food Bazaar_: A series of counters with different south and east Asian food. Huge portions for cheap.
  - _GOLD Restaurant_: Many dishes from across Africa, in combination with dancing, singing, and drumming.
  - _Tadka_: Nice Indian restaurant. One of Cape Town's rolling blackouts started while we were there, which made for an interesting atmosphere.
- See
  - _Table Mountain_: Take the cable car to the top for incredible views on all sides.
- Do
  - _Ocean Wonder_: Ride around the harbour in a very small boat to get up-close views of local wildlife.
