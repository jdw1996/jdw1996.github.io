<!-- Things to Eat, See, and Do -->
<!-- 2023-01-22 -->

Around the time I moved away from New York City, I compiled a list of things to eat, see, and do there, as a reminder for myself when I visited in the future, but also as a guide for anyone else I knew who might be going.
I've realized it would be useful to store similar information for all the cities I visit.
That's what this list is.
Along with each destination other than Toronto, where I live now, and Kitchener, where I grew up and my parents still live, I'll list the last time I visited, to give an idea of how dated my experience is.
The idea is to update this list over time instead of posting new lists in the future.

## North America

### Canada

#### Kitchener-Waterloo

- _La Cucina_: Really nice Italian in downtown Kitchener.
- _Lancaster Smokehouse_: My favourite restaurant in KW, they do really solid southern-style barbeque. The pulled pork is my recommendation.

#### Toronto

- _Burgers n' Fries Forever_: Very good burgers and fries.
- _Little India_: A little more formal than some Indian restaurants, they have excellent lamb vindaloo.
- _Matt's Burger Lab_: Excellent burgers.
- _Milagro_: Slightly upscale Mexican close to the Skydome.
- _Planta_: Vegan food that you wouldn't guess was vegan. There are a few locations but the Asian fusion one on Queen West is my favourite.
- _Salad King_: Cheap Thai and other southeast Asian food, there are a couple locations.
- _Sizzler Kabab_: My favourite butter chicken, with big chunks of meat and lots of flavour. And delicious garlic naan slathered in butter.

### United States

#### Nashville (March 2023)

- Eat
  - _Biscuit Love_: Best biscuits I've ever had. They're flaky like a croissant, but still distinctly biscuits. Try the chronic bacon too.
  - _Cheap Charlie's Taco Shop_: Best tacos I've ever had, served out of a trailer in a gas station parking lot.
  - _DeSano Pizza Bakery_: It's weird to say that the best pizza you've ever had is at a chain in Nashville, Tennessee. I was skeptical too until I tried it.
  - _Hattie B's Hot Chicken_: Best chicken tenders I've ever had.
  - _Martin's Bar-B-Que Joint_: Best ribs I've ever had, until I went to Peg Leg Porker. Tender but not fatty or greasy.
  - _Peg Leg Porker BBQ_: Everything I liked about Martin's ribs, but even better.
- See
  - _The Listening Room_: Pretty modern venue that books good shows, with a variety of singer-songwriters. The food is good too.
  - _Station Inn_: A dive bar with good music, especially bluegrass. My favourite show in Nashville was the bluegrass drop-in they hold every Sunday night.
  - _Hatch Show Print_: Take a tour of the print shop to see how Nashville concert posters are made.
- Do
  - _Korean War Veterans Memorial Bridge_ or _John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge_: Walking over either bridge gives a good view of the city skyline.

#### New York City (June 2022)

[See my separate post on NYC.](/2019-03-08-things-to-see-and-do-in-nyc)

### Trinidad and Tobago (July 2023)

#### Trinidad

- _Wings Roti Shop_: You get to choose from a variety of veggie and meat curries, eaten with roti. All that I tried were good but the pumpkin and mango stand out.
- _Swaggy's Roti_: I had their stew chicken and it was delicious.

#### Tobago

- _Crusty Crab_: I wasn't too fond of crab and dumplings, which Tobago is famous for, but their stew chicken, steamed fish, ground provisions, and beans were all delicious.

## Europe

### Germany

#### Berlin (October 2022)

- _Brammibal's Donuts_: Delicious vegan doughnuts.
- _Shakespeare and Sons_: Bagels and books.

### Spain

#### Barcelona (October 2022)

- _Amigo doner kebab y pizzería_: Delicious doner not far from Park Güell.

#### Granada (October 2022)

- _Grana Pizza_: Delicious and cheap pizza.
- _Jerusalem Restaurant_: Best falafel I've ever had, and super cheap.

## Africa

### South Africa

#### Cape Town (October-November 2022)

- Eat
  - _Bihari_: Nice Indian restaurant in a hotel.
  - _The Black Sheep_: Very well done food, from a variety of cultures. I had pappardelle with braised beef and mushrooms.
  - _Eastern Food Bazaar_: A series of counters with different south and east Asian food. Huge portions for cheap.
  - _GOLD Restaurant_: Many dishes from across Africa, in combination with dancing, singing, and drumming.
  - _Tadka_: Nice Indian restaurant. One of Cape Town's rolling blackouts started while we were there, which made for an interesting atmosphere.
- See
  - _Table Mountain_: Take the cable car to the top for incredible views on all sides.
- Do
  - _Ocean Wonder_: Ride around the harbour in a very small boat to get up-close views of local wildlife.
