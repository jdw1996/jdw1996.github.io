<!-- Hello, World! -->
<!-- 2017-01-08 -->

I just finished setting up my blog and this is the first post.

What am I going to post about?
To quote Napoleon Dynamite, ["Whatever I feel like I wanna... Gosh!"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlcXNB8xHqw&t=0m2s).
There won't be any consistent theme.
Some of the things I'll probably write about: programming, books, technology, math, language, baseball.

I don't expect too many people to read the blog, but if nothing else, it might
encourage me to write more.
