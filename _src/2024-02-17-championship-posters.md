Starting with Super Bowl LVI, I started creating illustrations to represent the teams in each of the big four North American men's pro sports championships.
Usually I take inspiration from uniform or logo elements.

## Super Bowl LVI

Los Angeles Chargers 23, Cincinnati Bengals 20

"Los Angeles @ Cincinnati @ Los Angeles"

I can't think of another team in any sport, besides the Rams, who uses a spiral motif, so I wanted to emphasize that.
Using two different sets of spirals, the background and the eyes, was meant to show that the Rams were both a participant in the game and the host of the game, as it was played in their stadium.

## 2022 NBA Finals

Golden State Warriors 4, Boston Celtics 2

"San Francisco vs Bay State"

Warriors blue and yellow combine to make Celtics green.
The design uses the Celtics' famous parquet floor to create the icons of the two teams: the Bay Bridge and a shamrock, respectively.
I like that Golden State uses the state nickname in their team name; they're the only big four team to do it, but [as I've written about, I'm fascinated by state nicknames](/2020-04-12-state-nickname-teams.html).

## 2022 Stanley Cup Finals

Colorado Avalanche 4, Tampa Bay Lightning 2

"Avalanches vs Lightnings"

I liked the idea that both teams could be represented by zigzags.
Tampa's is pretty clear, but Colorado's is based on [the mountains around the waist of their jerseys](https://www.sportslogos.net/logos/view/810232018/Colorado_Avalanche/2018/Dark_Uniform) and the [flag of the city of Denver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Denver).

## 2022 World Series

Houston Astros 4, Philadelphia Phillies 2

"Phillies vs Houies"

[Astros "tequila sunrise"](https://www.sportslogos.net/logos/view/6177521975/Houston_Astros/1975/Jersey_Logo) fades into [Phillies red and royal](https://www.sportslogos.net/logos/view/7024892019/Philadelphia_Phillies/2019/Jersey_Logo), then [Phillies burgundy and powder blue](https://www.sportslogos.net/logos/view/7025061973/Philadelphia_Phillies/1973/Jersey_Logo).

## Super Bowl LVII

Kansas City 38, Philadelphia Eagles 35

I didn't want to play up KC's indigenous imagery, so I stayed simple here by contrasting the texture of the Eagles' wing with the edge of KC's arrowhead.

## 2023 NBA Finals

Denver Nuggets 4, Miami Heat 1

This was a pretty straightforward combination of the Nuggets' mountain with the Heat's flames.

## 2023 Stanley Cup Finals

Vegas Golden Knights 4, Florida Panthers 1

"Nevada Knights vs Lauderdale Golden Panthers"

These two teams have a surprising number of common aesthetic elements.
Both use gold prominently, along with red and a darker shade, black and grey for Vegas and navy for Florida.
Both have shields in their logos.
I averaged a colour between Vegas grey and Florida navy for the background and picked a shield shape somewhere between the two.
The main imagery was a split between the Knights' mask and the Panther head, but I went back to the [superior front-facing panther for inspiration, specifically the simplified one in the roundel](https://www.sportslogos.net/logos/view/ejsvf6ira3ggsff4mjrxh4ree/Florida_Panthers/2010/Alternate_Logo).
When Florida went through their most recent redesign, they introduced an [updated front-facing panther](https://www.sportslogos.net/logos/view/1322432017/Florida_Panthers/2017/Alternate_Logo) but then never used it on a jersey, which is a waste because it's a much more unique logo.

## 2023 World Series

Texas Rangers 4, Arizona Diamondbacks 1

"Texa-zona Ranger-backs"

While not geographically the southwestern-most World Series (I'm thinking Giants versus Angels in 2002 probably was?) this must have been the most southwestern themed.
Thinking about snakes and cowboy hats, I decided to combine them in something that would look like an old-fashioned tattoo.
And while the Rangers haven't used cowboy boots in their iconography as much as hats, I couldn't pass up an alternate "There's a snake in my boot!" design.

## Super Bowl LVIII

Kansas City 25, San Francisco 49ers 22

"Kan Francisco"

I was hoping Baltimore would win the AFC championship so that I could do a design based on the Maryland flag, but this turned out OK too.
The obvious link for me was the very similar monograms these two teams have.
From there I extrapolated similar monograms for every team in the league and included those in the teams' most unique colours, to maximize variety.
Of course I let SF and KC stand out in the middle, and generally kept NFC teams on the left and AFC on the right, with playoff teams closer to the centre.
