<!-- Sporting Events I Attended -->
<!-- 2023-01-28 -->

For a few years I made posts about baseball games I'd attended in the preceding year.
I haven't done that since the pandemic, but I've been tracking the sporting events I've attended in my own notes.
Since my sporting interests have diversified, it doesn't make as much sense to separate posts into seasons, the way it did when I only really followed baseball.
This is meant to be an ongoing post where I'll track events I've attended, including many different sports.
