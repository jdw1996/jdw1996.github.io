<!-- Sporting Events I Attended -->
<!-- 2023-01-22 -->

For a few years I made posts about baseball games I'd attended in the preceding year.
I haven't done that since the pandemic, but I've been tracking the sporting events I've attended in my own notes.
Since my sporting interests have diversified, it doesn't make as much sense to separate posts into seasons, the way it did when I only really followed baseball.
This is meant to be an ongoing post where I'll track events I've attended, including many different sports.

## 2022-06-13

| ----------------- | ----- | ---------------- |
| Baltimore Orioles | 1     | Kyle Bradish     |
| Toronto Blue Jays | 11    | Alek Manoah      |

Alejandro Kirk recorded his 100th career hit.
Toronto batted around in the bottom of the fifth.
Baltimore challenged a 1-3 ground out, saying it was a hit by pitch.
The ruling was that he was hit by the pitch, but the batter clearly swung and it was strike three, so I'm not sure why they bothered.
