<!-- Joseph Winters -->

**You've reached my website.**

I'm Joseph Winters and I'm a fourth-year student at the
[University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), working towards a Bachelor of
Mathematics degree with a major in
[combinatorics and optimization](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/)
and minors in [computer science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) and
[pure mathematics](https://uwaterloo.ca/pure-mathematics/).  I love
programming, solving puzzles, watching baseball, and reading science fiction.

I'm currently working on data statistics for query processing at
[SAP](https://sap.com), but I've previously worked for the
[Jonah Group](https://jonahgroup.com) and TrustPoint Innovation Technologies
(now a part of [ESCRYPT](https://escrypt.com)).

I also have some personal projects available online, including
[a game called *Touch the Bees!*](https://github.com/jdw1996/touch-the-bees),
[a command-line program to conjugate French verbs](https://github.com/jdw1996/french-conjugator),
[a site to randomly generate names for pubs](https://github.com/jdw1996/pub-name-generator),
and [my solutions](https://github.com/jdw1996/cryptopals) to the
[Matasano Cryptopals challenges](https://cryptopals.com/).
