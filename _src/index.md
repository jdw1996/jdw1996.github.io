<!-- Joseph Winters -->

**You've reached my website.**

I'm Joseph Winters and I'm a full-stack developer at [HomeX](https://homex.com/).
In the past, I've worked at [Broadway Technology](http://www.broadwaytechnology.com/), [SAP](https://sap.com), [Jonah Group](https://www.jonahgroup.com) and TrustPoint Innovation Technologies (now a part of [ESCRYPT](https://escrypt.com)).
I graduated from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) with a Bachelor of Mathematics degree with a major in [combinatorics and optimization](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/) and minors in [computer science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) and [pure mathematics](https://uwaterloo.ca/pure-mathematics/).
I love programming, solving puzzles, watching baseball, and reading science fiction.

Some personal projects I've worked on are available online, including [a game called *Touch the Bees!*](/touch-the-bees), [a game based on *Pong*](/retro-table-tennis), [a command-line program to conjugate French verbs](https://github.com/jdw1996/french-conjugator), [a site to randomly generate names for pubs](https://github.com/jdw1996/pub-name-generator), and [my solutions](https://github.com/jdw1996/cryptopals) to the [Matasano Cryptopals challenges](https://cryptopals.com/).
