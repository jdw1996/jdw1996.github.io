<!-- Sporting Events I Attended -->
<!-- 2023-01-22 -->
<p>For a few years I made posts about baseball games I’d attended in the preceding year. I haven’t done that since the pandemic, but I’ve been tracking the sporting events I’ve attended in my own notes. Since my sporting interests have diversified, it doesn’t make as much sense to separate posts into seasons, the way it did when I only really followed baseball. This is meant to be an ongoing post where I’ll track events I’ve attended, including many different sports.</p>

<p>Berríos was perfect through 4.2 innings. Bo Bichette hit two home runs. Marcus Semien hit his 44th home run, which some considered to set a record for home runs in a single season by a second baseman, although he also hit home runs as a shortstop and possibly DH, if I remember correctly.</p>

<p>Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit his 48th home run, breaking Eddie Mathews’ record for home runs in a season at age 22 or younger. George Springer hit a grand slam.</p>
<p>In order to make the playoffs, Toronto needed either the Yankees or Red Sox to lose. The Yankees were tied 0-0 until the ninth inning of their game. The Red Sox were down 5-1 but came back to win while the game was broadcast on the jumbotron in Toronto.</p>

Toronto clinched a playoff berth.</p>

<p>Dane Evans took over for Masoli partway through the game. This was the East Division final and the Argos first home loss of the year. All Toronto points were scored by kicker Boris Bede: six field goals and a rouge.

<p>Alejandro Kirk recorded his 100th career hit. Toronto batted around in the bottom of the fifth. Baltimore challenged a 1-3 ground out, saying it was a hit by pitch. The ruling was that he was hit by the pitch, but the batter clearly swung and it was strike three, so I’m not sure why they bothered.</p>
