<!-- Writing My Own Static Site Generator with a Makefile -->
<!-- 2018-03-12 -->
<p>Over the past couple of months I’ve been writing my own static site generator (SSG). Previously, I had built this site using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, but I realized that I wasn’t using a majority of the features it offered, and I wanted to have more control over how my SSG worked. I also thought it would be fun to implement my own.</p>
<p>At the beginning of January I started to implement the program in Python, because that’s the language I have the most experience in, and I find it well-suited to string manipulation. Because of schoolwork, I worked on it only sporadically for the next couple of months. In that time, I realized that file manipulation was more important than string manipulation, but decided the <code>os</code> module from Python’s standard library worked well enough for what I needed.</p>
<p>This went on until I came across <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16483889">a discussion</a> about makefiles a couple of weeks ago on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. The comments were a fairly even mix of criticism and praise, but they were enough to convince me to consider switching my SSG to be a makefile instead of a Python script. I had worked with <code>make</code> briefly for building C++ programs for my <a href="http://www.ucalendar.uwaterloo.ca/1718/COURSE/course-CS.html#CS246">object-oriented programming course</a> but at the time it seemed unintuitive and I mainly just used a file the prof provided. Going back and re-learning the tool, though, I realized how useful it could be in this situation, as it handled most of the hardest parts of writing the SSG automatically, without adding much overhead. To paraphrase <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule">Greenspun’s Tenth Rule</a>, my Python script contained an ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of <code>make</code>. By making the switch, I went from 300 lines of Python and counting, to a little more than 40 lines of code in a makefile. It also went from something I worked on off and on for several months to something I finished in the course of a few nights. I made a few adjustments to my plans to make the SSG easier to write for <code>make</code>, but all core functionality remains.</p>
<p>As was planned from the beginning, my SSG, nicknamed “Muad’Dib”, is designed with the layout of this website in mind, and so likely won’t be suitable for any other site. That being said, anyone is welcome to use Muad’Dib and edit it to meet their needs. If you do this, I’d love to see the result.</p>
<p>The code for the Muad’Dib SSG can be found <a href="https://github.com/jdw1996/muaddib-ssg/">here</a>.</p>
